            This spring, my technical course load covered programming abstractions and
            paradigms, linear algebra, and differential equations. I also studied the
            product development process and worked closely with my classmates in
            pitching two app designs integrating effective and inclusive UI design
            practices.

            Outside the classroom, I help implement the matching algorithms
            for <Hyperlink cl={dmClass} href={dmHref} text={dmText} />, a matchmaking
            app that works closely with local businesses to connect students over free
            food. Iâ€™m also involved with the Harvard Computer Society and dance for
            Expressions.
